Hi, my name is Jiamin Wu, and I obtained my Master's in Economics from [Northeastern University](https://www.northeastern.edu/) in May 2024, with a concentration in Data Science for Economics and a GPA of 3.96.  

With a strong foundation in both economics and data science, I've developed practical skills in Python, SQL, and R, along with hands-on experience in data cleaning, statistical modeling, and financial analysis. My coursework in applied econometrics, machine learning, and fintech has equipped me to analyze complex datasets and deliver actionable insights in both business and financial contexts.  

Previously, I've interned at [IBM](https://www.ibm.com/us-en) in strategic consulting, [China Construction Bank](https://en.ccb.com/eng/home/index.shtml) in data management, and [East Coast Realty](https://www.eastcoastrealty.com/) in digital marketing analytics. These roles have allowed me to lead and support data-driven projects, from identifying operational bottlenecks and improving regulatory compliance to increasing customer engagement and transaction volumes through analytical insights.

I'm currently exploring opportunities in the job market for roles such as Data Analyst, Financial Analyst, or Fintech Analyst, where I can combine my quantitative background, technical skills, and business understanding to create value for organizations. I'm especially interested in positions that involve interpreting data to support strategic decision-making, improve operational efficiency, or contribute to financial growth.

Thank you for considering my profileâ€”I'd love the opportunity to discuss how I can contribute to your team.
